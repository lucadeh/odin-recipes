            <h2> Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pancakes are one of the most comforting 
            and iconic breakfast foods, celebrated 
            for their soft, fluffy texture and mild, 
            buttery flavor. Made from a light batter of flour, 
            eggs, milk, and baking powder, they cook quickly into 
            golden rounds that are perfect for soaking up maple syrup. 
            Their simplicity allows endless creativity, 
            whether topped with fruit, chocolate, honey, 
            or a pat of melting butter.
        </p>
        <p>With roots in many cultures around 
            the world, pancakes have become a 
            timeless favorite appreciated for their 
            versatility and ease of preparation. 
            Whether cooked on a hot griddle at home 
            or enjoyed at a cozy café, their tender crumb 
            and warm aroma make them a comforting start to any day. 
            Pancakes remain a staple thanks to their balance of 
            simplicity, flavor, and endless possibilities.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>10 pancakes</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour<strong> 195 g</strong></li>
            <li>Sugar <strong> 2 tbsp</strong></li>
            <li>Baking powder <strong> 1 tbsp</strong></li>
            <li>Milk <strong> 295 ml</strong></li>
            <li>Eggs <strong> 1</strong></li>
            <li>Butter <strong> 70 g</strong></li>
             <li>Vanilla essence <strong> 2 tsp</strong></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the butter:</strong> Melt the butter and set it aside to cool slightly.
            <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
            <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Don’t worry if the butter solidifies a little.
            <li><strong>Mix the batter: </strong> Create a well in the center of your dry ingredients. 
                Pour the milk mixture into the well and gently whisk until the flour is just incorporated. 
                A few small lumps are perfectly normal. As the batter rests, you should see it begin to bubble. It will be thick, like cake batter. If it seems too thick, add a splash more milk to thin it out.
            <li><strong>Preheat the skillet: </strong> Place a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. To check if it’s ready, sprinkle a few drops of water on the surface. They should “dance” around and evaporate quickly.
            <li><strong>Cook the pancakes: </strong> Brush the skillet with melted butter for crispy edges (you can skip this if using a good nonstick pan). Scoop the batter onto the skillet using a 1/4 cup measure or a large cookie scoop, then gently spread each pancake into a 4-inch circle.
            <li><strong>Flip the pancakes: </strong> After 1 to 2 minutes, the edges will look dry, and bubbles will form and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until they’re lightly browned and cooked through. Enjoy your pancakes right away with warm syrup, more butter, and berries.
