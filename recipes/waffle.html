          <h2> Description</h2>
        <p>
            Waffles are a beloved breakfast classic known 
            for their crisp exterior, soft interior, 
            and signature honeycomb pattern that holds 
            toppings perfectly. Made with a simple batter 
            of flour, eggs, milk, butter, and a touch of sugar, 
            waffles become golden and airy when cooked in a hot waffle iron. 
            Their delightful texture and subtle sweetness allow flavors 
            like maple syrup, fruit, or whipped cream to shine.
        </p>
        <p>Originating in Europe and evolving through centuries, 
            waffles have become a universal favorite enjoyed 
            in countless variations. Whether served as a cozy 
            morning treat or dressed up for dessert, their combination
            of warmth, crunch, and softness makes them irresistible. 
            From Belgian-style deep pockets to thin, crispy versions, 
            waffles continue to charm with their comforting simplicity.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>4 people</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour <strong>332 g</strong></li>
            <li>Baking powder<strong> 2.5 tsp</strong></li>
            <li>Sugar <strong> 24 g</strong></li>
            <li>Milk <strong>198 ml</strong></li>
            <li>large eggs <strong>2</strong></li>
            <li>vanilla essence<strong> 1/2 tsp</strong></li>
            <li>unsalted butter<strong> 90 g</strong></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Whisk dry:</strong> - place the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk to mix.
             <li><strong>Whisk in wet:</strong> - Add milk, eggs and vanilla. Whisk to combine. Add melted butter then whisk until lump free. The batter should be pourable but thick, slightly thinner than pancakes.
            <li><strong>Recommended resting:</strong> - Cover then refrigerate overnight, or for at least 2 hours. Softer insides, better flavour. Else, proceed immediately with cooking.
            <li><strong>Preheat:</strong> a waffle maker (Note 2, inc setting options). A non stick one will not need oil, plus there is butter in the batter.
            <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Use a ladle to pour batter in to just cover the iron. Don't get greedy, it will leak out the sides! Cook until golden and crisp, my good waffle iron takes 3 1/2 minutes, my Kmart one takes 6 minutes.
             <li><strong>Serving:</strong> Transfer onto plates and serve as you go, with desired toppings. Or, put on a rack and keep warm in a preheated 70°C/150°F oven while you continue cooking!
        </ol>
